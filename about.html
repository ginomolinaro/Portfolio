     <p>
        I believe in the powers that forced me to become the man I am today. When I was younger I never really challenged myself.
        I played guitar for two weeks and played 6 different sports. That all changed about a year ago when I decided to become
        a designer. Taking a break from school, I was working odd jobs in between to pay my bills and get by. Sometime later I got inspired
        by hearing about my friends doing well at their job and in life so I decided to take action to become a better person. I enrolled in a Computer Science degree at Regis
        University in Colorado, only to find out how expensive school actually was and how unrealistic paying for classes is without a scholarship
        or state grant money. I had a small moment of clarity when my cousin told me about UX and UI design. I started doing my research, landing me at a
        nine-month Bloc apprenticeship program focused on UX UI Design and Frontend Developement. So I did what no one thought I
        could and started from the bottom. I was soaking in everything I could about designing and putting forth my best effort to create
        something that resembles myself and my creativity. Now I can happily say that I've followed through with something, breaking grounds in my life, and changing it for the better.

     <h2>How I work</h2>
     <p>
     After taking this course I see UI in everything. I'm more determined than ever before to solve real human problems that people face everyday. Whether
     it's making a quicker onboarding or designing a brand new website from scratch,
     these are the types of challenges I love to face through a user-centered design process. I would describe myself as being a perfectionist. During my
     mentorship program at Bloc, I learned everything from how to craft a user survey and evaluate user research, to Information Architecture such as wireframes,
     user flows, user stories, etc, to UX principles, to visual design, to user testing and iteration, and to prototyping. I feel very comfortable taking
     a project from early inception through final implementation which could mean creating high fidelity prototypes in InVision. I like to iterate based
     on the findings of usability tests as much as possible. I like to test often and test early so that there aren't many problems down the road. Designing
     products based on user research is vital in my design process. What I believe to be important in creating a successful product are goal-driven design,
     usability, easy learning curve, feedback and iteration, familiar UI patterns, and strong visual design through a user-centered design process.

     <h2>Fun facts</h2>
     <p>
     I am a culture vulture. I take pleasure in the immense amounts of diversity that this world has to offer. You can catch me at an electronic, rock, or rap concert one day and the next
     finding the hottest locations to eat in the Denver area. I have a huge italian family that has supported me through this journey and
     I hangout with them as much as someone would hangout with their best friends. Also, I love anything that has to do with movies, video games, and pop culture. I'm one of the rare breeds that enjoys spending time on the internet and my phone.
