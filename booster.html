    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Plagued by the abundance of
       crowdfunding websites, I wanted to
       create a virtual stage to give
       underground internet content creators
       and their fans a place to go.

<div class="caseStudyChallenge">
    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>Originally, Booster was going to be a
       crowdfunding website for the
       entertainment industry but the
       competition was polluted. The trouble
       was how could I spin this and make it
       different.

       <pre>
       <h1>The Answer</h1>
       In a game show fashion the user will decide the creator’s fate. Updated
       monthly, Booster will review the newest pool of talent from platforms such as
       Youtube, Snapchat, Twitch, and film. Booster will then place them on the front
       page for user’s to vote through in an upvote and downvote system. If the
       creators get enough votes by the end of the month they will get rewarded.
       The prizes will range from new investors, cash, or even up to 1000 new fans.

        I started my research by targeting who our main audience would be. By
        sending out surveys for both content creators and the potential users of Booster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important things were noted. Booster would end up being used
        primarily for entertainment purposes while also keeping a
        crowdfunding backbone. According to the survey results, I
        dropped a lot of features that I originally had planned.

          Kickstarter is for entertainers and generally supports
          new and unique ideas. Gumroad is not much of a
          competitor but would be selling things to a certain
          viewer kind of like Booster. Social sharing gives Gumroad
          a unique advantage to stand out.

          Patreon is the main competitor for Booster. They are
          heavily entertainment driven for all creative types and
          hit on the same user base that we do. They have a
          system that works and a solid website.
        </p>
        <p>
          GoFundMe is a competitor known by their name, not by
          website design or demographic. They are the most
          generic crowdfunding site out there. IndieGoGo is great
          for the underground scene. They could prove to be a big
          competitor because they appeal to the startup industry,
          and also very investor friendly.

    By exploring personal experiences

    Also including one casual fan that is
    looking for something new and

    <h1>User Stories &amp; Flow</h1>
    <p>
      Due to time constraints and a limit on website capabilities the user
      stories had an original flow that got changed later to accomodate this. It
      stayed true to the core features but also some smaller things got left
      behind after we further conducted research. I had to leave out analytics,
      a rewards system, email notifications will play a role when the creators
      get reviewed.

    Digging deep for inspiration, the first iteration was random and chaotic.
    It only worked as an aesthetic design until I did some user testing to
    clarify what I wanted to portray better later in the project. This was my
    first iteration of something I wasn’t happy with.

    After these mockups started to take shape, it also
    shaped how my project would look in the end. But
    based on time constraints and how far we wanted to go,
    that helped dictate the overall tone of Booster.

    Leaving it all to user testing, I gathered what information I
    could and re-designed my mockups having a new mindset.
    Not relying on my guts to iterate a design was worth it in
    the end. The Booster look finally came about.

    Heavy inspiration came from my mood board that I
    created. Neon-underground was the original idea but
    after further testing, it was better off going with a more
    natural, minimilistic, and clean feel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The colors changed from neon pinks and purples to
    lighter blue and red, giving it much more personality.
    Adding shapes is what gave it character. Learning how
    to fight with this process and the struggling contrasts, I
    landed on more greys and whites based on more user
    research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I kept the logo design because the underground feeling
    made sense to me and is where I come from as a person.
    I like to see things emerge and become successful.

    Hitting some major speedbumps on the

  <pre>
    What I learned  <i class="arrow right"></i>

    At one point I thought it was all going to fall apart. Making sure I came
    out on top after hitting a roadblock of inspiration was a major key. Having
    my original product not work out taught my a lot about slowing down. It
    took a lot to get it right and big projects like these can't be rushed.

    What would I have done differently  <i class="arrow right"></i>

    Given the proper amount of time I would have loved to expand on the user
    settings, an interactive video for the front pages, as well as adding a
    pop up tutorial that would help users figure out the mechanics.

    How will I use this information in the future  <i class="arrow right"></i>

    I learned to trust what others had to say, while also steering clear of
    feedback that may not have helped. I know where my skills are as a
    designer, I’ve pinpointed a lot of my strengths and weaknesses while also
    exploring some new territories while building out Booster.
