           In a game show fashion the user will decide the creator’s fate. Updated
           monthly, Booster will review the newest pool of talent from platforms such as
           Youtube, Snapchat, Twitch, and film. Booster will then place them on the front
           page for user’s to vote through in an upvote and downvote system. If the
           creators get enough votes by the end of the month they will get rewarded.
           The prizes will range from new investors, cash, or even up to 1000 new fans.

        I started my research by targeting who our main audience would be. By
        sending out surveys for both content creators and the potential users of Booster. Some
        important things were noted. Booster would end up being used
        primarily for entertainment purposes while also keeping the
        crowdfunding backbone. According to the survey results, I
        dropped a lot of features that I originally had planned.

        <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <p>
          Kickstarter is for entertainers and generally supports
          new and unique ideas. Gumroad is not much of a
          competitor but would be selling things to a certain
          viewer kind of like Booster. Social sharing gives Gumroad
          a unique advantage to stand out.

        <br>
        <p>
          Patreon is the main competitor for Booster. They are
          heavily entertainment driven for all creative types and
          hit on the same user base that we do. They have a
          system that works and a solid website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          GoFundMe is a competitor known by their name, not by
          website design or demographic. They are the most
          generic crowdfunding site out there. IndieGoGo is great
          for the underground scene. They could prove to be a big
          competitor because they appeal to the startup industry,
          and also very investor friendly.

        <p>
          Will casually stumbles around the internet looking for the next best thing. He is
          intrigued by talented people. Would love to see new talent get exposed but at the same
          time they have to know what they are doing. Will Doesn’t like amateurs, both online
          and in real life. Will forgets things easily, sidetracked by many things, but stays
          productive. Will has talent himself and gets inspiration from seeing how others handle
          their business.

          Kate wants a place to go where she can elevate her content. She wants to be seen by

  <h1>Branding</h1>
  <p>
    Heavy inspiration came from my mood board that I
    created. Neon-underground was the original idea but
    after further testing, it was better off going with a more
    natural, minimilistic, and clean feel.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The colors changed from neon pinks and purples to
    lighter blue and red, giving it much more personality.
    Adding shapes is what gave it character. Learning how
    to fight with this process and the struggling contrasts, I
    landed on more greys and whites based on more user
    research.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I kept the logo design because the underground feeling
    made sense to me and is where I come from as a person.
    I like to see things emerge and become successful.

  <h1>The User Testing</h1>
  <p>
  My user testing reults for Booster proved how, for big projects, you need as many
  eyes as you can get. My mentor for Bloc made sure that I get at least a few Skype
  sessions in, or face to face meetings if I could, so that I could really get
  the most out of the user testing. It proved useful to say the least, giving me the
  exact results I needed to shape Booster into my favorite project I've ever worked
  on.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  The Results had a lot to do with learning how to deal with making big changes and using
  them to my advantage. Gathering the results together and seeing what I could change. The
  biggest change was the project details page. Going from a completely different color switch
  was a tricky process but the most rewarding. Also navigation and color issues continue to be
  the biggest takeaway for me and what I need to work on most as a new designer.

    What I've learned  <i class="arrow right"></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    At one point I thought it was all going to fall apart. Making sure I came
    out on top after hitting a roadblock of inspiration was a major key. Having
    my original product not work out taught me a lot about slowing down. It
    took a lot to get it right and big projects like these can't be rushed.
    <br>
    <br>
    What I would've done differently  <i class="arrow right"></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Given the proper amount of time I would have loved to expand on the user
    settings, an interactive video for the front pages, as well as adding a
    pop up tutorial that would help users figure out the mechanics.
    <br>
    <br>
    How I will use this information in the future  <i class="arrow right"></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    I learned to trust what others had to say, while also steering clear of
    feedback that may not have helped. I know where my skills are as a
    designer, I’ve pinpointed a lot of my strengths and weaknesses while also
    exploring some new territories while building out Booster.
