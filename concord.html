    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>For my first Bloc assignment in their program we were tasked with creating
       a file sharing, bookmarking, and collaboration website. Blocbox which is
       known as Concord was a true test of my abilities as a designer. Alot of
       our deliverables were given to help us maintain pace and reach a certain goal.

    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>Creating a website that was unique. I wanted something that was different
       from my classmate’s submissions. This was my first take on using what I
       learned and blending it with my own personality.

       <h1>The Answer</h1>
       I wanted to convey a message of fun and playful while maintaining
       simplicity and modernistic designs. Where businesses and users can go
       to collaborate, bookmark, and share content they found online as well
       as personal things. All of this was the driving force that led me to
       look at companies like Discord and Evernote to gain inspiration on
       exactly they were thinking.

      I started my research by targeting who our main audience would be. By
      sending out surveys for both content creators and the potential users of Booster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important things were noted. Booster would end up being used
      primarily for entertainment purposes while also keeping a
      crowdfunding backbone. According to the survey results, I
      dropped a lot of features that I originally had planned.

    <pre>
      Discord was my main inspiration for shaping Concord
      into what it is today. Discord has a solid marketing pitch
      on their website with a brilliant layout, a catchy name,
      and a good color scheme. I ran with those ideas in mind
      and came up with Concord.

      Evernote was the side competition. Its what drove the
      file saving and organizing aspect of my entire website. So
      I wanted to take what they’ve succeeded most with and
      try to spin it in my own creative way. Concluding with a
      more friendly and fun take for users of all ages.

<div class="caseStudyPersonaBox">
  <h1>Personas</h1>
  <p>
    I felt it was essential to stick to what I
    know and not deviate to try and think
    of users that don’t fit the userbase.
    Their goals and frustrations really
    helped me get inspired for the design
    and layouts to come. It also helped
    me with some of the core features
    and buttons that were needed.

    This was going to be for my login, settings, and miscellanous

    Trying to explain to the user that its more than just a simple note
    sharing website and that it has everything you need to feel
    comfortable to keep you coming back.

<div class="caseStudyWireframes">
  <h1>Wireframes</h1>
  <p>
    Consistency is what I wanted throughout
    this whole project. In some ways it
    worked and some ways it didn’t. The wireframes came out very differently
    than my finished product, and based on user testing, that changed it again. I
    stuck with some ideas that felt right to me but changed my home page of
    Concord the most.

<div class="caseStudyMockups">
  <h1>Mockups / First edition</h1>
  <p>
    The user research conducted was arguing for more bolder hue’s of purple.
    Also the settings section of Concord’s main dashboard would be hard to
    see if the page fills up with boxes. A lot of this would be fixed later on,
    especially with the future hope that this would be a more simple fix by
    adding a pop up tutorial.

    After conducting a preference test and getting a majority vote of the newly
    designed home page below, all of the pieces came together. The dashboard got
    a facelift and so did the smaller pages. Once again relying on user testing
    is the key to any successful design project and Concord is the perfect example
    of that.

<div class="caseStudyBranding">
  <h1>Branding</h1>
  <img src="images/Booster/icons8-brain-100.png">
  <p>
    The branding started with finding a logo started with symmetrical
    letters but then was followed by shape design. After I saw what a wireframe
    image looks like it hit me. That’s when I landed on the Concord
    box logo. It shows creation can happen by finding inspiration in the
    smaller things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Belgrano and Open Sans were the first fonts I chose. After the preference
    test of the two home pages, I used more of Concord's logo font throughout
    the page instead. It really gave it a more modern and up to date look
    without looking like Evernote or one of the competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purple and gold colors came from big inspiration after seeing the Sketch
    application website. It’s the first palette that popped into my head giving
    me the idea to really use purple throughout the whole project.

<div class="caseStudyConclusion">
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    What didn’t work: Coding websites through HTML and CSS is not one of
    my strengths. I really had to work for this one. Pages were buggy and full
    of messy layout code. I had this grand scheme of how it needed to look
    and not delivering on the coding side of taught me a big lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    What would I have done differently:  Trying to not go through as many
    iterations of the home page and dashboard that I did. Everything else was
    spot on but those were the main struggles, both on the coding side and
    designing side.
  </p>
  <p>
    How will I use this information in the future:  Preference tests and user
    testing helped save me from some bad design choices and looks. I want to
    use that to the best of my abilities in the future and on future projects.
