    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>For my first Bloc assignment in their program we were tasked with creating
       a file sharing, bookmarking, and collaboration website. Blocbox which is
       known as Concord was a true test of my abilities as a designer. Alot of
       our deliverables were given to help us maintain pace and reach a certain goal.

       learned and blending it with my own personality.

       <h1>The Answer</h1>
       <p>
       I wanted to convey the message of fun and playful while maintaining a
       simplistic and modern design. An app where businesses and users can go
       to collaborate, bookmark, and share content they find online as well
       as other personal things. All of this was the force leading me to get huge
       amounts of inspiration from our competitors and use that to build a great
       product.

      A bookmark centered design will be the main goal here because the responses
      show a lot of people use bookmark tools to save content. It needs to be convenient
      and easy to use like Microsoft Note or Google Keep. As well making it
      useful on iPhones and androids.
    </p>

    <p>
      Designers, Web developers, and other technology related fields seem to use
      these tools more. More work is done in a collaborative environment
      and sharing resources with co-workers is a must. Concord needed to be
      an app you could use anywhere.

      Discord was my main inspiration for shaping Concord
      into what it is today. Discord has a solid marketing pitch
      on their website with a brilliant layout, a catchy name,
      and a good color scheme. I ran with those ideas in mind
      and came up with Concord.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Evernote was the side competition. Its what drove the
      file saving and organizing aspect of my entire website. So
      I wanted to take what they’ve succeeded most with and
      try to spin it in my own creative way. Concluding with a
      more friendly and fun take for users of all ages.

            While using his phone and laptop to browse articles, videos, and social media profiles,
            Eljam is familiar with most pop culture news. He saves a lot of images and also bookmarks
            inside the browser. He uses Chrome because it’s quick and easy. Most of his daily notes he uses a
            pen and paper to write down things making it tough to stay organized. He works in a
            collaborative environment and only sometimes shares news with co-workers.

            Eljam needs things to be organized better with an ability to access

            Roshan is a working man and loves spending free time looking at News and Videos online.
            Although he doesn’t like saving any links and only uses Chrome bookmarking occasionally,
            he'll most likely forget what he saved. Roshan frequents Evernote a lot because it syncs to
            both his phone and laptop. He likes to keep the notes and bookmarks to himself but still shares
            them with close friends.
          </p>
          <h3>Frustration</h3>
          <p>
            Roshan likes apps like Evernote, but they have their pros and cons. He would love to switch
            to something else but hasn't found a good alternative. Roshan can’t get to his personal
            bookmarks unless he’s on his laptop. He wants to be able to save images and links faster.

    Consistency is what I wanted throughout
    this whole project. In some ways it
    worked and some ways it didn’t. The wireframes came out very differently
    than my finished product, and based on user testing, that changed it again. I
    stuck with some ideas that felt right to me but changed my home page of
    Concord the most.

<div class="caseStudyMockups">
  <h1>Mockups / First Edition</h1>
  <p>
    The user research conducted was arguing for more bolder hue’s of purple.
    Also the settings section of Concord’s main dashboard would be hard to
    see if the page fills up with boxes. A lot of this would be fixed later on,
    especially with the future hope that this would be a more simple fix by
    adding a pop up tutorial.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Roadblock &amp; Solution</h1>
  <p>
    After conducting a preference test and getting a majority vote of the newly
    designed home page below, all of the pieces came together. The dashboard got
    a facelift and so did the smaller pages. Once again relying on user testing
    is the key to any successful design project and Concord is the perfect example
    of that.

<div class="caseStudyBranding">
  <div class="concordBrandingTextSide">
  <h1>Branding</h1>
  <p>
    The branding started with finding a logo started with symmetrical
    letters but then was followed by shape design. After I saw what a wireframe
    image looks like it hit me. That’s when I landed on the Concord
    box logo. It shows creation can happen by finding inspiration in the
    smaller things.
  </p>
    <br>
   <p>
    Belgrano and Open Sans were the first fonts I chose. After the preference
    test of the two home pages, I used more of Concord's logo font throughout
    the page instead. It really gave it a more modern and up to date look
    without looking like Evernote or one of the competitors.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p>
    The purple and gold colors came from big inspiration after seeing the Sketch
    application website. It’s the first palette that popped into my head giving
    me the idea to really use purple throughout the whole project.

<div class="caseStudyUserTesting">
  <div class="testingText">
  <h1>The User Testing</h1>
  <p>
  My school, Bloc, handed us a majority of the deliverables for our Blocbox (Concord) project.
  Therefore what helped the most was preference testing everything I could. As you can see below,
  I created two different home pages, two different dashboards, and settings tweaks that would later turn into
  the final project that you see.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  The Results on my home page preference test were just what I expected. After looking at the original design for long
  enough, I decided to make some font and color tweaks. My first home page design was using a lot of the deliverables
  and design techniques my school taught me. That changed when I went to revisit the design after a couple months.
  Bolder hues, better font use, and an overall more compelling design led the users to decide on this design rather than
  my original.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  The Results for my dashboard preference test went differently. I created a top navigation dashboard originally and wanted to
  add something different in the mix. Creating a right navigation dashboard only led to confusion and wasted time. Users were
  saying how hard it would be for responsive coding, but loved the cleaner look of it. Leading to a struggle, it was only natural
  to take the majority vote here and stick with the original design leading to bolder purples and other minor tweaks to make the whole
  project come together nicely.

  <p>
    What didn’t work  <i class="arrow right"></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Coding websites through HTML and CSS is not one of my strengths. I really
    had to work for this one. Pages were buggy and full of messy layout code.
    I had this grand scheme of how it needed to look and not delivering on
    the coding side of taught me a big lesson.
    <br>
    <br>
    What I would've done differently  <i class="arrow right"></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Trying to not go through as many iterations of the home page and dashboard
    that I did. Everything else was spot on but those were the main struggles,
    both on the coding side and designing side.
    <br>
    <br>
    How I will use this information in the future  <i class="arrow right"></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Preference tests and user testing helped save me from some bad design
    choices and looks. I want to use that to the best of my abilities in
    the future and on future projects.
