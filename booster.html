    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Plagued by the abundance of
       crowdfunding websites, I wanted to
       create a virtual stage to give
       underground internet content creators
       and their fans a place to go.
    </p>
  </div>
<div class="caseStudyChallenge">
    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>Originally, Booster was going to be a
       crowdfunding website for the
       entertainment industry but the
       competition was polluted. The trouble
       was how could I spin this and make it
       different.
    </p>
   </div>

   </div>
<div class="caseStudyAnswer">
    <img src="images/Booster/icons8-lightbulb-520.png"></a>
    <h1>The Answer</h1>
    <p>In a game show fashion the user will decide the creator’s fate. Updated
       monthly, Booster will review the newest pool of talent from platforms such as
       Youtube, Snapchat, Twitch, and film. Booster will then place them on the front
       page for user’s to vote through in an upvote and downvote system. If the
       creators get enough votes by the end of the month they will get rewarded.
       The prizes will range from new investors, cash, or even up to 1000 new fans.

<div class="caseStudyUserResearch">
    <h1>User Research</h1>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <img src="images/Booster/icons8-comments-512.png" width="60" height="60"></a>
    <h2>Survey Tools</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I started my research by targeting who our main audience would be. By
      sending out surveys for both content creators and the potential users of Booster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important things were noted. Booster would end up being used
      primarily for entertainment purposes while also keeping a
      crowdfunding backbone. According to the survey results, I
      dropped a lot of features that I originally had planned.

<div class="caseStudyAnalysis">
    <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      Kickstarter is for entertainers and generally supports
      new and unique ideas. Gumroad is not much of a
      competitor but would be selling things to a certain
      viewer kind of like Booster. Social sharing gives Gumroad
      a unique advantage to stand out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patreon is the main competitor for Booster. They are
      heavily entertainment driven for all creative types and
      hit on the same user base that we do. They have a
      system that works and a solid website.
    </p>
    <p>
      GoFundMe is a competitor known by their name, not by
      website design or demographic. They are the most
      generic crowdfunding site out there. IndieGoGo is great
      for the underground scene. They could prove to be a big
      competitor because they appeal to the startup industry,
      and also very investor friendly.

<div class="caseStudyPersonaBox">
  <h1>Personas</h1>
  <p>
    By exploring personal experiences
    using Snapchat, Twitch, and human
    connections I wanted to showcase
    creators that would use my platform
    as a source for new fans and money.
    Also including one casual fan that is
    looking for something new and
    exciting.

<div class="caseStudyUserStories">
  <h1>User Stories &amp; Flow</h1>
  <p>
    Due to time constraints and a limit on website capabilities the user
    stories had an original flow that got changed later to accomodate this. It
    stayed true to the core features but also some smaller things got left
    behind after we further conducted research. I had to leave out analytics,
    a rewards system, email notifications will play a role when the creators
    get reviewed.

<div class="caseStudyWireframes">
  <h1>Wireframes</h1>
  <p>
    Digging deep for inspiration, the first
    iteration was random and chaotic. It only
    worked as an aesthetic design until I did
    some user testing to clarify what I
    wanted to portray better later in the
    project. This was my first iteration of
    something I wasn’t happy with.

<div class="caseStudyMockups">
  <h1>Mockups / First edition</h1>
  <p>
    After these mockups started to take shape, it also
    shaped how my project would look in the end. But
    based on time constraints and how far we wanted to go,
    that helped dictate the overall tone of Booster.

<div class="caseStudyRoadblock">
  <h1>Mockups / Roadblock &amp; Solution</h1>
  <p>
    Leaving it all to user testing, I gathered what information I
    could and re-designed my mockups having a new mindset.
    Not relying on my guts to iterate a design was worth it in
    the end. The Booster look finally came about.

<div class="caseStudyBranding">
  <h1>Branding</h1>
  <img src="images/Booster/icons8-brain-100.png"></a>
  <p>
    Heavy inspiration came from my mood board that I
    created. Neon-underground was the original idea but
    after further testing, it was better off going with a more
    natural, minimilistic, and clean feel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The colors changed from neon pinks and purples to
    lighter blue and red, giving it much more personality.
    Adding shapes is what gave it character. Learning how
    to fight with this process and the struggling contrasts, I
    landed on more greys and whites based on more user
    research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I kept the logo design because the underground feeling
    made sense to me and is where I come from as a person.
    I like to see things emerge and become successful.

<div class="caseStudyFinishedProject">
  <h1>The Finished Project</h1>
  <p>
    Hitting some major speedbumps on the
    way, I finally figured it out. Choosing my
    color, backgrounds, and layout wouldn’t
    have been possible without user research
    and I found out how pivotal that part of
    designing is.

<div class="caseStudyConclusion">
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    At one point I thought it was all going to fall apart. Hitting that roadblock
    of inspiration and having the original look not work, it took a lot to get it
    right. Bigger projects can’t be rushed. Given the proper amount of time I
    would have loved to expand on the user settings, an interactive video for
    the front pages, as well as adding a pop up tutorial that would help users
    figure out the mechanics. I learned to trust what others had to say, while
    also steering clear of feedback that may not have helped. I know where
    my skills are as a designer, I’ve pinpointed a lot of my strengths and
    weaknesses while also exploring some new territories while building
    Booster.
