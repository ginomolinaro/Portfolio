    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>For my first Bloc assignment in their program we were tasked with creating
       a file sharing, bookmarking, and collaboration website. Blocbox which is
       known as Concord was a true test of my abilities as a designer. Alot of
       our deliverables were given to help us maintain pace and reach a certain goal.

<div class="caseStudyChallenge">
    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>Creating a website that was unique. I wanted something that was different
       from my classmate’s submissions. This was my first take on using what I
       learned and blending it with my own personality.

       <pre>
       <h1>The Answer</h1>
       I wanted to convey the message of fun and playful while maintaining a
       simplistic and modern design. An app where businesses and users can go
       to collaborate, bookmark, and share content they find online as well
       as other personal things. All of this was the force leading me to get huge
       amounts of inspiration from our competitors and use that to build a great
       product.

      A bookmark centered design will be the main goal here because the responses
      show a lot of people use bookmark tools to save content. It needs to be convenient
      and easy to use like Microsoft Note or Google Keep. As well making it
      useful on iPhones and androids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designers, Web developers, and other technology related fields seem to use
      these tools more. More work is done in a collaborative environment
      and sharing resources with co-workers is a must. Concord needed to be
      an app you could use anywhere.

      Discord was my main inspiration for shaping Concord
      into what it is today. Discord has a solid marketing pitch
      on their website with a brilliant layout, a catchy name,
      and a good color scheme. I ran with those ideas in mind
      and came up with Concord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evernote was the side competition. Its what drove the
      file saving and organizing aspect of my entire website. So
      I wanted to take what they’ve succeeded most with and
      try to spin it in my own creative way. Concluding with a
      more friendly and fun take for users of all ages.

    I felt it was essential to stick to what I
    know and not deviate to try and think
    of users that don’t fit the userbase.
    Their goals and frustrations really
    helped me get inspired for the design
    and layouts to come. It also helped
    me with some of the core features
    and buttons that were needed.

    sharing website and that it has everything you need to feel

<div class="caseStudyWireframes">
  <h1>Wireframes</h1>
  <p>
    Consistency is what I wanted throughout
    this whole project. In some ways it
    worked and some ways it didn’t. The wireframes came out very differently
    than my finished product, and based on user testing, that changed it again. I
    stuck with some ideas that felt right to me but changed my home page of
    Concord the most.

<div class="caseStudyMockups">
  <h1>Mockups / First edition</h1>
  <p>
    The user research conducted was arguing for more bolder hue’s of purple.
    Also the settings section of Concord’s main dashboard would be hard to
    see if the page fills up with boxes. A lot of this would be fixed later on,
    especially with the future hope that this would be a more simple fix by
    adding a pop up tutorial.

    After conducting a preference test and getting a majority vote of the newly
    designed home page below, all of the pieces came together. The dashboard got
    a facelift and so did the smaller pages. Once again relying on user testing
    is the key to any successful design project and Concord is the perfect example
    of that.

  <h1>Branding</h1>
  <p>
    The branding started with finding a logo started with symmetrical
    letters but then was followed by shape design. After I saw what a wireframe
    image looks like it hit me. That’s when I landed on the Concord
    box logo. It shows creation can happen by finding inspiration in the
    smaller things.<br>
    <br>
    Belgrano and Open Sans were the first fonts I chose. After the preference
    test of the two home pages, I used more of Concord's logo font throughout
    the page instead. It really gave it a more modern and up to date look
    without looking like Evernote or one of the competitors.<br>
    <br>
    The purple and gold colors came from big inspiration after seeing the Sketch
    application website. It’s the first palette that popped into my head giving
    me the idea to really use purple throughout the whole project.

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <pre>
    What didn’t work  <i class="arrow right"></i>

    Coding websites through HTML and CSS is not one of my strengths. I really
    had to work for this one. Pages were buggy and full of messy layout code.
    I had this grand scheme of how it needed to look and not delivering on
    the coding side of taught me a big lesson.

    What would I have done differently  <i class="arrow right"></i>

    Trying to not go through as many iterations of the home page and dashboard
    that I did. Everything else was spot on but those were the main struggles,
    both on the coding side and designing side.

    How will I use this information in the future  <i class="arrow right"></i>

    Preference tests and user testing helped save me from some bad design
    choices and looks. I want to use that to the best of my abilities in
    the future and on future projects.
