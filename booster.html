    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Plagued by the abundance of<br>
       crowdfunding websites, I wanted to<br>
       create a virtual stage to give<br>
       underground internet content creators<br>
       and their fans a place to go.
    </p>

    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>Originally, Booster was going to be a<br>
       crowdfunding website for the<br>
       entertainment industry but the<br>
       competition was polluted. The trouble<br>
       was how could I spin this and make it<br>
       different.
    </p>
   </div>
<div class="booster7">
    <img src="images/"></a>
    <h1>The Answer</h1>
    <p>In a game show fashion the user will decide the creator’s fate. Updated<br>
       monthly, Booster will review the newest pool of talent from platforms such as<br>
       Youtube, Snapchat, Twitch, and film. Booster will then place them on the front<br>
       page for user’s to vote through in an upvote and downvote system. If the<br>
       creators get enough votes by the end of the month they will get rewarded.<br>
       The prizes will range from new investors, cash, or even up to 1000 new fans.
    </p>

    <h1>User Research</h1>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <h3>Survey Tools</h3>
    <p1>
      Slack<br>
      Facebook<br>
      Reddit<br>
      UserTesting.com<br>
    </p1>
    <p2>
      Google Forms<br>
      Usability Hub<br>
    </p2>
    <p3>
      I started my research by targeting who our main audience would be. By<br>
      sending out surveys for both content creators and the potential users of Booster.
    </p3>
    <p4>
      Important things were noted. Booster would end up being used<br>
      primarily for entertainment purposes while also keeping a<br>
      crowdfunding backbone. According to the survey results, I<br>
      dropped a lot of features that I originally had planned.

    <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
    <p1>
      Kickstarter is for entertainers and generally supports<br>
      new and unique ideas. Gumroad is not much of a<br>
      competitor but would be selling things to a certain<br>
      viewer kind of like Booster. Social sharing gives Gumroad<br>
      a unique advantage to stand out.
    </p1>
    <p2>
      Patreon is the main competitor for Booster. They are<br>
      heavily entertainment driven for all creative types and<br>
      hit on the same user base that we do. They have a<br>
      system that works and a solid website.
    </p2>
    <p3>
      GoFundMe is a competitor known by their name, not by<br>
      website design or demographic. They are the most<br>
      generic crowdfunding site out there. IndieGoGo is great<br>
      for the underground scene. They could prove to be a big<br>
      competitor because they appeal to the startup industry,<br>
      and also very investor friendly.

  <h1>Personas</h1>
  <p>
    By exploring personal experiences<br>
    using Snapchat, Twitch, and human<br>
    connections I wanted to showcase<br>
    creators that would use my platform<br>
    as a source for new fans and money.<br>
    Also including one casual fan that is<br>
    looking for something new and<br>
    exciting.

<div class="booster11">
  <h1>User Stories &amp; Flow</h1>
  <p>
    Due to time constraints and a limit on website capabilities the user<br>
    stories had an original flow that got changed later to accomodate this. It<br>
    stayed true to the core features but also some smaller things got left<br>
    behind after we further conducted research. I had to leave out analytics,<br>
    a rewards system, email notifications will play a role when the creators<br>
    get reviewed.
  </p>

<div class="booster12">
  <h1>Wireframes</h1>
  <p>
    Digging deep for inspiration, the first<br>
    iteration was random and chaotic. It only<br>
    worked as an aesthetic design until I did<br>
    some user testing to clarify what I<br>
    wanted to portray better later in the<br>
    project. This was my first iteration of<br>
    something I wasn’t happy with.

  <h1>Mockups / First edition</h1>
  <p>
    After these mockups started to take shape, it also<br>
    shaped how my project would look in the end. But<br>
    based on time constraints and how far we wanted to go,<br>
    that helped dictate the overall tone of Booster.

  <h1>Mockups / Roadblock &amp; Solution</h1>
  <p>
    Leaving it all to user testing, I gathered what information I<br>
    could and re-designed my mockups having a new mindset.<br>
    Not relying on my guts to iterate a design was worth it in<br>
    the end. The Booster look finally came about.

  <h1>Branding</h1>
  <img src="images/"></a>
  <p1>
    Heavy inspiration came from my mood board that I<br>
    created. Neon-underground was the original idea but<br>
    after further testing, it was better off going with a more<br>
    natural, minimilistic, and clean feel.
  </p1>
  <p2>
    The colors changed from neon pinks and purples to<br>
    lighter blue and red, giving it much more personality.<br>
    Adding shapes is what gave it character. Learning how<br>
    to fight with this process and the struggling contrasts, I<br>
    landed on more greys and whites based on more user<br>
    research.
  </p2>
  <p3>
    I kept the logo design because the underground feeling<br>
    made sense to me and is where I come from as a person.<br>
    I like to see things emerge and become successful.

  <h1>The Finished Project</h1>
  <p>
    Hitting some major speedbumps on the<br>
    way, I finally figured it out. Choosing my<br>
    color, backgrounds, and layout wouldn’t<br>
    have been possible without user research<br>
    and I found out how pivotal that part of<br>
    designing is.

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    At one point I thought it was all going to fall apart. Hitting that roadblock<br>
    of inspiration and having the original look not work, it took a lot to get it<br>
    right. Bigger projects can’t be rushed. Given the proper amount of time I<br>
    would have loved to expand on the user settings, an interactive video for<br>
    the front pages, as well as adding a pop up tutorial that would help users<br>
    figure out the mechanics. I learned to trust what others had to say, while<br>
    also steering clear of feedback that may not have helped. I know where<br>
    my skills are as a designer, I’ve pinpointed a lot of my strengths and<br>
    weaknesses while also exploring some new territories while building<br>
    Booster.
